# odin-project-landing-page

This is a landing page I created through the Odin Project curriculum. This page was created with HTML and CSS only. I may come back sometime in the future to add some Javascript, but since it is not required for this particular project, I decided to omit it. 

I formatted this page with desktops and tablets in mind, so it should be fully responsive from 500px and above. As with Javascript, I will make this page mobile-friendly sometime in the future.
